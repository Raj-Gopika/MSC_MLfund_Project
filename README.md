# MSC_MLfund_Project
Fundamentals of ML project

## Overview
In this assignment students have the opportunity to consolidate their learning in the Machine
Learning Concepts unit by creating a working solution for a real-world, industry-based
machine learning problem. It involves typical tasks such as data understanding, exploration,
cleaning, and preparation; and machine learning model selection, tuning, fitting, evaluation,
and analysis.

More specifically, you will work with a Car Sale Adverts dataset provided by AutoTrader
(AT), one of our industry partners. The dataset contains an anonymised collection of adverts with
information on vehicles such as brand, type, colour, mileage, as well as the selling price. Your main
task is to produce a regression model for predicting the selling price given the characteristics of
the cars in the historical data given. This type of task is similar to that addressed by AT’s machine
learning engineers and data scientists in the implementation of the price indicator feature in AT’s
website.

You are expected to produce, as deliverable, a brief, structured report containing snippets of
code and explanations that address the set of machine learning tasks defined here. Also, you must
hand in a single fully-documented, reproducible Python notebook with the rough work
that forms that basis of your report.
Obtaining and Exploring the Dataset

Please note the following license information before downloading and using the dataset:

• this dataset provided by AutoTrader is to be used only by students enrolled on 6G7V0015
(24/25). Students can place it in their personal storage spaces (e.g., MMU OneDrive) for
carrying out their practical data science and machine learning work (e.g., with Jupyter Lab).
Please do not redistribute the dataset.
It is available in our Moodle area here as a .csv file, and it has around 400K rows.

## Machine Learning Tasks to Perform
In order to address the main task of producing a regression model for price prediction, you need to
implement and run the following tasks that are typical of a Machine Learning pipeline, using our
usual environment (i.e., Python ecosystem/notebooks):

1. Data/Domain Understanding and Exploration (e.g., load the data, sample observations,
check correct parsing of data, identify quantitative and qualitative features, analyse data
distributions (e.g., range, centrality, dispersion, shape), identify good predictors, process the
data for visualisation and exploration).

3. Data Processing for Machine Learning (e.g., detect and deal with noise (i.e., erroneous
values), missing values, and outliers; subset, reshape, and engineer features for machine
learning purposes; categorically-encode, rescale data; split data into predictors and target;
obtain train/validation/test folds).

5. Model Building (e.g., choose suitable algorithm(s), fit and tune models; grid-search, rank,
and select model(s) on based on evaluation metrics and under/overfit trade-off).
6. Model Evaluation and Analysis (e.g., evaluate selected model(s) with score/loss metrics
with cross-validation, analyse actual vs predicted plot, gain and discuss insights based on
feature importance, analyse individual predictions and distribution of scores/losses together
with predictors; for an interpretable model, briefly discuss about its structure).
